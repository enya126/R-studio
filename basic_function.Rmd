**This homework is due on January 28, 2022 by 11:59pm. You will submit a pdf file on Gradescope.**

*For all questions, include the R code that you used to find your answer (show R chunk and outputs). Answers without supporting code will not receive credit (unless no code was required). Outputs without comments will not receive credit either: Write full sentences to describe your findings.*

### Question 1: (2 pts)

##### The dataset `mtcars` was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and other aspects of automobile design and performance for different cars (1973â€“74 models). Look up the documentation for this data frame with a description of the variables by typing `?mtcars` in the console pane. Take a look at the first 6 rows of the dataset by using an `R` function in the code chunk below. Do you know about any (or all) of these cars?

```{r}
# look at the first 6 rows
head(mtcars)

```

I used head function to look at first 6 rows of this data frame.\
I am not familiar with cars, so I don't know any of these cars.

### Question 2: (2 pts)

##### How many rows and columns are there in this data frame in total? 
```{r}
dim(mtcars)
```


There are 32 rows and 11 columns in this data frame.

### Question 3: (2 pts)

##### When is your birthday? Grab the value of `mpg` that corresponds to the day of your birthday (should be a number between 1 and 31). 

```{r}
# choose the 'mpg' value corresponding to my birthday
mtcars$mpg[26]

```

I used my brithday, 26, as index to  find a specific 'mpg' value, and the value is 27.3.

---

### Question 4: (2 pts)

##### Recall how logical indexing of a data frame works in R. To refresh your memory, in the example code below I ask R for the number of rows in the dataset where the variable `mpg` takes on values greater than 30. What is the comma doing in the code below (i.e., why is it necessary)?

```{r}
# Find the number of rows with nrow()
nrow(mtcars[mtcars$mpg > 30, ])
```

The comma is separating conditions for rows and columns, and tells R that all columns are selected with rows 'mpg'>30. If we remove the comma, then we didn't specify the columns and an error would occur.

### Question 5: (2 pts)

##### Find the mean value of the numeric variable of your choice among: `disp`, `hp`, `drat`, `wt`, or `qsec`. Make sure to report the mean with its corresponding unit. 

```{r}
# find my choice 'wt' from the data frame
# then find mean of 'wt'
mean(mtcars$wt)
```

The mean value of weight is 3.21725 lbs of all different cars in this data frame. 

---

### Question 6: (4 pts)

##### Let's make a plot in base R. Create a scatterplot to investigate the relationship between `mpg` and the numeric variable of your choice among: `disp`, `hp`, `drat`, `wt`, or `qsec`. Make sure to give a title to the graph. Comment on the relationship.

```{r}
# scatterplot of mpg and wt in the data frame
# add title and x, y labels
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, main = 'Relationship between mpg and weight', xlab='weight', ylab='mpg')

```

There looks like a correlation between weight and mpg. When weight increases, mpg decreases.

### Question 7: (3 pts)

##### Check that your code is well documented with comments in the R chunks. Make sure you wrote sentences and reported units when necessary.

*No answer needed*

### Question 8: (3 pts)

##### Knit your file into html. Is it working? If not, try to decipher the error message (look up the error message, consult websites such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [crossvalidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/). Once it knits and the html window pops out, click on `Open in Browser` at the top left. Print your html file into pdf from your browser. Any issue? Ask your classmates, come by student hours! 

*No answer needed*
